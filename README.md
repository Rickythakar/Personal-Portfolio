# Personal-Portfolio
My first personal portfolio project for coding bootcamp 
This is my first portfolio for the coding bootcamp.
It will be updated through the course with projects that I complete and publish online.
The ground work of the portfolio is that it will have my name, a bio, my projects, and a contact me section along with a navigation bar that goes with it.

Below is a link for my portfolio.
